Try to answer these questions:

1. What is the difference between list and tuple?

2. What is the difference between `for` loop and `while` loop?
Answer: A 'for' loop iterates through an iterable object; a 'while' loop 
keeps running until a given condition is met. Because of this, we can say

loop will run, while we will use the 'for' loop when then number of 
iterations is defined.
